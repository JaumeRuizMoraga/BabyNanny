About Our App

BabyNanny is a mobile application designed to simplify and monitor infant care. It allows users to track essential developmental data such as physical growth, feeding schedules, and sleep patterns, providing real-time updates and visual feedback for one or more profiles simultaneously.

Key Features:
Comprehensive Tracking: Log weight, height, age, feedings, and sleep cycles.

Real-Time Data: Instant synchronization and updates across the platform.

Multi-Profile Support: Manage multiple babies within a single user account.

Visual Feedback: Intuitive data representation to monitor growth trends at a glance.

Developed with a focus on practical utility over social networking, the app was inspired by the real-life challenges of parenting. It aims to support anyone—from young parents to grandparents—by streamlining the complex process of infant care through efficient data management and calculation.
